        <h1> What is Barnhunt?</h1>
        <p>Not everyone will understand the importance of “rat catchers,” but if you live in the countryside, you sure do! “Rat catchers” rid farms of destructive vermin – 
            and the hunting and teamwork skills required to do so are the foundation of the sport of Barn Hunt. Dogs and their handlers work as a team to locate and mark rats 
            (which are always safely held in aerated tubes) hidden in a maze of straw or hay bales. Some breeds are specifically created to fill this role as well as some mixed 
            breeds being up to the task, but as long as your dog can fit through an 18″ wide by bale-height tall tunnel, hes eligible! “Barn Hunt tests the nose, speed, agility, 
            and surefootedness of dogs that have a history of above-ground vermin hunting,” said Robin Nuttall, founder of the Barn Hunt Association.” Barn Hunt events include a 
            pass/fail instinct class for owners who want to familiarize their dog with the test. Courses are made increasingly difficult by adding more obstacles, additional diversions 
            and more rats to find.
