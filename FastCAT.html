         <h1> What is FastCAT?</h1>
        <p>Sure, you think your dog is fast. But have you ever wondered how fast? Can your dog outrun Usain Bolt, 
        who has been called the fastest runner in the world? They just might: Usains fastest time has been clocked 
        at almost 28 mph – yet dogs have been known to reach speeds of 35-45 mph.Well, you no longer have to wonder how 
        fast your dog can run. Fast CAT® – which stands for Coursing Ability Test – is a timed 100-yard dash where dogs 
        run one at a time, chasing a lure. Its over before you know it — and its nothing short of awe-inspiring to watch 
        your dog run at top speed, ears back, eyes focused, legs strong. And if your dog is really fast, you might earn bragging 
        rights if their name makes onto our list of top 20 fastest dogs by breed! All dogs can participate in Fast CAT, whether 
        purebred or mixed breed.
